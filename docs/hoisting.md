# [Hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)
Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations to the top of a scope (the global scope or the current function scope).

That means that you are able to use a function or a variable before it has been declared, or in other words: a function or variable can be declared after it has been used already.
